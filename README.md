## Quickstart

### Before you begin

1.  [Select or create a Cloud Platform project][projects].
1.  [Enable billing for your project][billing].
1.  [Enable the Cloud Run API][enable_api].
1.  [Set up authentication with a service account][auth] so you can access the
    API from your local workstation.

### Installing the client library

```bash
npm install @google-cloud/run
```


### Using the client library

```javascript
/**
 * TODO(developer): Uncomment these variables before running the sample.
 */
/**
 *  Required. The location and project to list resources on.
 *  Location must be a valid GCP region, and may not be the "-" wildcard.
 *  Format: projects/{projectnumber}/locations/{location}
 */
// const parent = 'abc123'
/**
 *  Maximum number of Services to return in this call.
 */
// const pageSize = 1234
/**
 *  A page token received from a previous call to ListServices.
 *  All other parameters must match.
 */
// const pageToken = 'abc123'

/**
 *  If true, returns deleted (but unexpired) resources along with active ones.
 */
// const showDeleted = true
// Imports the Run library
const {ServicesClient} = require('@google-cloud/run').v2;

// Instantiates a client
const runClient = new ServicesClient();

async function callListServices() {
  // Construct request
  const request = {
    parent,
  };

  // Run request
  const iterable = await runClient.listServicesAsync(request);
  for await (const response of iterable) {
    console.log(response);
  }
}

callListServices();

```



## Samples

Samples are in the [`samples/`](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-run/tree/main/samples) directory. Each sample's `README.md` has instructions for running its sample.

| Sample                      | Source Code                       | Try it |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------ |
| Quickstart | [source code](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-run/blob/main/samples/quickstart.js) | [![Open in Cloud Shell][shell_img]](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?git_repo=https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-run&page=editor&open_in_editor=samples/quickstart.js,samples/README.md) |



The [Cloud Run Node.js Client API Reference][client-docs] documentation
also contains samples.

## Supported Node.js Versions

Our client libraries follow the [Node.js release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).
Libraries are compatible with all current _active_ and _maintenance_ versions of
Node.js.
If you are using an end-of-life version of Node.js, we recommend that you update
as soon as possible to an actively supported LTS version.

Google's client libraries support legacy versions of Node.js runtimes on a
best-efforts basis with the following warnings:

* Legacy versions are not tested in continuous integration.
* Some security patches and features cannot be backported.
* Dependencies cannot be kept up-to-date.

Client libraries targeting some end-of-life versions of Node.js are available, and
can be installed through npm [dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag).
The dist-tags follow the naming convention `legacy-(version)`.
For example, `npm install @google-cloud/run@legacy-8` installs client libraries
for versions compatible with Node.js 8.

## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).




This library is considered to be in **beta**. This means it is expected to be
mostly stable while we work toward a general availability release; however,
complete stability is not guaranteed. We will address issues and requests
against beta libraries with a high priority.
